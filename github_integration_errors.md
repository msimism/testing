# GitHub Integration Errors

## Error: MCP error -32603: Invalid arguments: content.encoding: Required, content.content: Required

**Explanation:** This error occurred when I was trying to create or update a file in the GitHub repository. The GitHub API requires the `content` parameter to be an object with `content` and `encoding` properties.

**Potential Fix:** When creating or updating a file, pass the `content` parameter as an object with the file contents and the encoding, like this:

```json
{
  "content": "This is the file content.",
  "encoding": "utf-8"
}
```

## Error: MCP error -32603: GitHub API error: Unprocessable Entity

**Explanation:** This error occurred a few times when I was trying to create a new branch or merge the `dev` branch into the `main` branch. It indicates that the GitHub API request was not accepted for some reason.

**Potential Fixes:**
1. Check the state of the repository and ensure there are no conflicts or other issues that would prevent the branch creation or merge.
2. Ensure all required parameters are provided correctly for the specific GitHub API call.
3. If the issue persists, you may need to troubleshoot further by checking the GitHub API documentation or contacting GitHub support.

## Error: Input validation errors occurred: Invalid JSON: control character (\u0000-\u001F) found while parsing a string at line 2 column 0

**Explanation:** This error occurred when I was trying to create a new file called `github_integration_errors.md`. It seems there was an issue with the JSON formatting of the file content.

**Potential Fix:** Ensure the file content you are trying to write is valid JSON, without any control characters or other formatting issues.
