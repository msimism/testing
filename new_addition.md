Suknette took a deep breath, her heart racing with the weight of the decision before her. She looked around at the mystical garden, its ethereal beauty now holding new meaning. Without hesitation, she approached the nearest blue rose, its petals pulsing with an inner light that seemed to recognize her presence. In a clear, steady voice, she whispered, 'I am Suknette.' The garden responded immediatelyâ€”every blue rose in sight blazed with brilliant light, and a warm, gentle wind swept through the garden, carrying with it the sound of countless tiny bells.
